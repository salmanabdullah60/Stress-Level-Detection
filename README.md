# Stress-Level-Detection
##overview

In this project, logistic regression and a naive Bayes model were trained on a preprocessed dataset to predict participants' stress levels. The classification report and confusion matrix visualization showed good precision and recall scores for the stressed and non-stressed classes, indicating that the model could correctly identify stressed and non-stressed participants. Still, it had a slightly lower recall score for the highlighted course.
